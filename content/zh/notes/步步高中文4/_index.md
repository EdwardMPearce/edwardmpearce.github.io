## 预备课 Preparatory Lesson

### 对话一 Dialogue One

Student: Driver, I'd like to go to Beijing Language and Culture University.

Driver: Okay. You have so much luggage, is it okay to put the small case on top of the large suitcase?

Student: There are bottles in the big suitcase, please be careful not to break them.

Driver: I'm afraid I won't be able to fit everything in the car boot.

Student: In that case, put the small suitcase on the seat beside me.

Driver: Okay. Please get in the car.

Student: Thank you.

Driver: Have you come here (to Beijing) to study?

Student: That's right. I've come to study Chinese for a year.

Driver: Where are you from?

Student: It's hard to say in only a few words. My father is from France and my mother is from Germany.

Driver: Where were you born?

Student: Germany. However, when I was one year old I moved to France. It was in France that I grew up.

Driver: Where did you go to school?

Student: I went to primary school in France, and I went to middle school and university in the UK.

Driver: What country is written on your passport?

Student: I've got two passports. One is French and the other is British.

Driver: Then you can only say that you're European.

Student: Yes, I'm European, West European.

### 对话二 Dialogue Two

Student: Driver, is Beijing's traffic always this crowded?

Driver: Today's not so bad, sometimes it's even more crowded.

Student: I really didn't expect Beijing to have this many cars; it's just like London.

Driver: Nowadays there are more wealthy people, and so the number of people with cars is also higher.

Student: I heard that China is the kingdom of bicycles, where everybody commutes by bike.

Driver: That time has passed. Nowadays, people travel by car, by subway, public bus, private shuttle bus, taxi, bicycle... Every kind of transport.

Student: Driver, is there a congestion charge for entering the city by car in Beijing?

Driver: No, you don't need to pay. I've heard that you have to pay a 5 pounds congestion charge to drive into London, is that right?

Student: It's gone up. You need to pay 8 pounds now.

Driver: That's too much! 8 pounds a day is equivalent to more than 100 Chinese yuan.

Student: It may be a lot, but there are fewer people driving to work now and the traffic is much better.

Driver: What about taxi drivers? They drive in the city every day. Do they have to pay the charge?

Student: Actually I think they don't need to pay it.

Driver: That sounds about right.

### 课文 Text

#### 画儿是谁偷的？Who stole the painting?

Mr Zhang is a police officer. This evening he received a phone call. 

He couldn't hear the voice of the caller clearly, only somebody saying: A famous painting at the art gallery has been stolen.

After putting the phone down he went straight to the gallery. Inside the gallery there were two members of staff, one who works the morning shift, and another who works the evening shift.

Mr Zhang asked them: "Who was it that discovered the painting had been stolen?"

The evening shift worker said: "He only told me just now."

Mr Zhang asked the morning shift worker: "At what time did you discover that the painting had been stolen?"

The morning shift worker replied: "Just now. When I was closing the gallery two hours ago the painting was still here. 
On the way home I realised I had forgotten something in the office, so I came back here again.
After I got here I discovered that the painting has disappeared."

At this point Mr Zhang asked: "Who do you (two) think stole the painting then?"

The morning shift worker said: "I don't know who made the telephone call, but they're definitely connected to whoever stole the painting."
