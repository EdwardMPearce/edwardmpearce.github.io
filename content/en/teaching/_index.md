## Private tutoring

I am available for hire as a private tutor for mathematical and scientific topics up to degree level. Please [contact]({{< ref "/#contact" >}}) me to make an inquiry.

I have previously tutored on mathematics at the levels between GCSE, A Level, and degree level, most recently for a 2nd year engineering student, as well as participating in outreach and voluntary activities at primary and secondary levels. I have also provided proofreading services for essays and dissertations to masters students.
