## Private tutoring and outreach activities

I have previously tutored on mathematics at the levels between GCSE, A Level, and degree level, most recently for a 2nd year engineering student,
as well as participating in outreach and voluntary activities at primary and secondary levels.
I have also provided proofreading services for essays and dissertations to masters students.

## Educational blog posts

Listed below are links to a collection of short posts on topics of mathematical interest and curiosity which I wrote as background material for undergraduate Python programming tutorials.
