## Private tutoring

I have previously tutored on mathematics at the levels between GCSE, A Level, and degree level, most recently for a 2nd year engineering student, 
as well as participating in outreach and voluntary activities at primary and secondary levels. 
I have also provided proofreading services for essays and dissertations to masters students.
