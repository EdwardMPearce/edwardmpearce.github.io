## Equivariant Hilbert schemes and partition combinatorics

As a PhD student I study interactions between algebraic geometry and combinatorics, in particular understanding topological properties of orbifold Hilbert schemes via core and quotient partitions and G-constellations. This work is under the supervision of Dr Paul Johnson. I have written an online [tutorial](https://edwardmpearce.github.io/tutorial-partitions/) (work-in-progress) as background material on the combinatorial aspect of my research.

## McKay Correspondence

In 2015 I secured a Â£1000 grant from the University of Warwick's Undergraduate Research Support Scheme ([URSS](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/skills/urss/)) to undertake an 8 week summer research project researching the 3D McKay correspondence.  I wrote code to compute McKay quivers for finite subgroups of SL(3,C) which can be found [here](https://github.com/edwardmpearce/urss-project). This work was under the supervision of Prof Miles Reid (FRS).

## Geometry of Syzygies 

My master's {{% staticref "files/mastersthesis.pdf" %}}thesis{{% /staticref %}} gives an introduction to minimal free resolutions and uses Macaulay2 to compute examples of toric varieties to test the Eisenbud-Goto regularity conjecture. This work was under the supervision of Prof Diane Maclagan.
